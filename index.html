        <p>Joe Higan is a Nukenin – a former ninja who escaped his clan and is hiding from his violent past in rural
            America with his family. One night, he is ambushed by a team of assassins from his former organization
            who
            exact a bloody retribution on Joe and his family for betraying their ancient code. Rising from his
            seeming
            "death," Joe will re-emerge as his former self – Ninja Kamui – to avenge his family and friends. Kamui
            is a
            21st century ninja, a shadowy anachronism who pits his ancient skills against high-tech weaponry with
            brutal
            finesse. He must face off against trained assassins, combat cyborgs, and rival ninjas to bring down the
            very
            clan that made him.
